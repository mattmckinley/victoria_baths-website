          municipal bathing institution in the country" and "a water palace of which every citizen of Manchester can be proud."
          Not only did the building provide spacious and extensive facilities for swimming, bathing and leisure, it was built of
          the highest quality materials with many period decorative features:- stained glass, terracotta, tiles and mosaic floors.
          Victoria Baths served the people of central Manchester for 87 years and established themselves in the affections of all
